# Product Recommendation System

## Overview

- This project focuses on building an Item-to-Item Recommendation System for a large-scale e-commerce dataset containing approximately 700,000 records. Various recommendation algorithms were explored, and after evaluation, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model was selected for deployment due to its high accuracy.

## Models Implemented

- We experimented with the following recommendation techniques:

- 1.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Basic Model âœ… (Finalized for Deployment)
- 2.Cosine Similarity-Based Recommendation
- 3.Single Value Decomposition (SVD)
- 4.Alternating Least Squares (ALS)

- After testing and evaluating all models, the KNN-based recommendation model was chosen for deployment as it provided the best balance of accuracy and efficiency.

## Deployment Details

- The selected KNN model is deployed using Streamlit.
- The application takes Product ID as input and returns the Top 5 recommended products based on item-to-item similarity.
